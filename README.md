Professional Portfolio/ resume

## Project Description
I created this portfolio to showcase my work and give a playground for what i am learning for the bootcamp i am currently in. I have a lot of idea for this project and will revisit often to showcase a welcoming home page, a simple and easy to use contact page, a page that will showcase my portfolio that has weblinks to my repo on githuhb, movies I am interested to show users what kind of entertainment i am interested in, and to finish it off I have about me page that has a photo and a little bit about my life.

### How to navigate my project
I added a navigation bar on the top right of the page that has a hover effect and a current selected page your currently browsing. Also on the home screen i added easy to use fun picture boxes that will take you to the respected text that are located below the picture boxes, There is a hover effect that enlarges the images. The icons on the bottom of the home page will take you to my Github, Facebook, Twitter, Discord.
